`Problem solving commented by one guy on Reddit`

Make sure you understand what the question is REALLY asking for.

EVERY problem solving through through these steps:

- Understand the problem thoroughly
    
- Understand the input data and expected output
    
- Understand the limits (i.e. the edge cases)
    
- Understand the algorithm(s) you may be using
    
- Try working out a sample case on paper (verify algorithm works for the problem)
    
- Try coding the problem and run it with test data
    
- Debug as needed
    
- If it doesn't work, figure out why
    
- Optimize as needed
    
- Switch approach as needed.
    
- Debugged and deliver solution!
    

What you are lacking basically is the first four steps, and you only get that with EXPRIENCE. If you have enough solutions already filed in your head, you can skip the first few steps and started testing on paper, or even jump straight to PC and start coding. But if you lack the fundamental knowledge then you need to build those up first, and you gain those by... solving more problems.
